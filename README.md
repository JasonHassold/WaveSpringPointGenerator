# Wave Spring Point Generator
Creates an ASCII point file of a wave spring. This is useful because it is difficult to make this shape in CAD software. The program is written in GoLang and takes a number of parameters about the spring and outputs two files. One for the inner diameter points, and one for the outer diameter points. The files are seperated by a space dilimeter in an X Y Z format.
